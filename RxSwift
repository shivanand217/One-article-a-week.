Rx swift 

* Observables
* Variables
* Dispose Bag


Variables: 

* These are to observe the RxSwift Observables.
* With these we use a value property to set up a new value.
* When we want to subscribe a variable we need to use asObservable() method.
* So after this setup whenever the value is changed, the observer is notified.
* Variable is guaranteed not to emit error so it makes things a bit simpler to handle on view controller side.

Observables: 
* These changes their states by emitting events.
* We need to subscribe to those events.
* Events can be onNext(), onError()

Dispose Bag:
* To destroy an observable we should always call dispose to it. 
* It would be very hard to handle the dispose manually, so RxSwift equips us with the DisposeBag.
* When creating an observable we should always add it to the dispose bag, by calling .disposed(by:) method. This way when the dispose bag is deallocated, it calls dispose() to all the observables, which take care of the memory they have used.
* So Inside the view-model we should define out own dispose bag, When the view model gets deallocated all the observables are deallocated as well.
